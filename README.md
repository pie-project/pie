**Pie** is a high-performance, programmable LLM serving system that empowers you to design and deploy custom inference logic and optimization strategies.

> **Note** ðŸ§ª
>
> This software is in a **pre-release** stage and under active development. It's recommended for testing and research purposes only.


## Getting Started

### Docker Installation

The easiest way to run Pie with CUDA support is using our pre-built Docker image.

**Prerequisites:**
- NVIDIA GPU (SM 8.0+), NVIDIA, and Docker
- Tested on Ubuntu 24.04, CUDA 12.7
- Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit

**Step 1: Pull Image and Download Model**

```bash
docker pull pieproject/pie:latest
mkdir -p ~/.cache
docker run --rm --gpus all -it -v ~/.cache:/root/.cache pieproject/pie:latest \
  pie model add "llama-3.2-1b-instruct"
```

- Models are downloaded into `~/.cache/pie/models/` and persist across container runs.

- FlashInfer's JIT-compiled kernels are cached in `~/.cache/flashinfer/` to avoid recompilation.


**Step 2: Run an Inferlet**
```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -it -v ~/.cache:/root/.cache pieproject/pie:latest \
  pie run --config /workspace/pie/docker_config.toml \
  /workspace/example-apps/text_completion.wasm -- --prompt "What is the capital of France?"
```

Note that the very first inferlet response may take a few minutes due to the JIT compilation of FlashInfer.

### Manual Installation

#### Prerequisites

- **Configure a Backend:**
  Navigate to a backend directory and follow its `README.md` for setup:
    - [Python Backend](backend/backend-python/README.md)


- **Add Wasm Target:**
  Install the WebAssembly target for Rust:

  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
  ```
  This is required to compile Rust-based inferlets in the `example-apps` directory.


#### Step 1: Build

Build the **CLIs** and the example inferlets.

1. **Build the engine `pie` and the client CLI `pie-cli`:**

   From the repository root, run

   ```bash
   cd pie && cargo install --path .
   ```

   Also, from the repository root, run
   ```bash
   cd client/cli && cargo install --path .
   ```

2. **Build the Examples:**

   From the repository root, run
   ```bash
   cd example-apps && cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release
   ```

#### Step 2: Configure Engine and Backend

1. **Create default configuration file:**

   Substitute `$REPO` to the actual repository root and run
   ```bash
   pie config init python $REPO/backend/backend-python/server.py
   ```

2. **Download the model:**

   The default config file specifies the expected model. Run the following command to download it.
   ```bash
   pie model add qwen-3-0.6b
   ```

3. **Test the engine:**

   Run an inferlet directly with the engine. Due to JIT compilation of FlashInfer kernels, the first run will have **very long** latency.
   ```bash
   pie run \
       $REPO/example-apps/target/wasm32-wasip2/release/text_completion.wasm \
       -- \
       --prompt "Where is the capital of France?"
   ```

#### Step 3: Run an Inferlet from a User Client

1. **Create User Public Key:**

   If you don't already have a key pair in `~/.ssh`, generate one with the following command.
   By default, the private key will be generated in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and the public key in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.
   Please make sure the passphrase is *empty*.
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```

   In addition to ED25519, you can also use RSA or ECDSA keys.

2. **Create default user client configuration file:**

   The following command creates a default user client configuration file using the current Unix username and the private key in `~/.ssh`.
   ```bash
   pie-cli config init
   ```

3. **Register the user on the engine:**

   Run the following command to register the current user on the engine.
   `my-first-key` is the name of the key and can be any string.
   `cat` reads the public key from `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and pipes it to `pie auth add`.
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pie auth add $(whoami) my-first-key
   ```

4. **Start the Engine:**

   Launch the Pie engine with the default configuration.
   ```bash
   pie serve
   ```

5. **Run an Inferlet:**

   From another terminal window, run
   ```bash
   pie-cli submit \
       $REPO/example-apps/target/wasm32-wasip2/release/text_completion.wasm \
       -- \
       --prompt "Where is the capital of France?"
   ```
