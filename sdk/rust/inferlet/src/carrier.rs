//! Run-ahead carrier mechanics — the two correctness-critical primitives for
//! pipelined (run-ahead + EOS-rollback) decoding on the raw WIT.
//!
//! In Gim's SDK-minimize thesis: the decode LOOP stays hand-written and VISIBLE
//! in each inferlet (see `runtime/tests/inferlets/runahead::decode_pipelined`).
//! Only the delicate, correctness-critical carrier mechanics are factored here
//! as a thin primitive so their leak/hang-safety is proven ONCE rather than
//! re-derived per inferlet:
//!   - the device carrier declaration (`next_inputs(&[0])`) that injects a
//!     pass's sample into the next pass's placeholder input row 0,
//!   - the cursor **advance-on-submit** (so an overlapped successor reserves its
//!     slot while this pass is still in flight),
//!   - the #26 dangling-carrier clear (`fresh_generate`) on a generate's first pass,
//!   - the depth-1 EOS-rollback discard (finalize-drain + cursor rollback).
//!
//! This is NOT a decode-loop helper — the inferlet writes the loop and the stop
//! logic; these are the ~2 primitives it calls. Mechanics owned by bravo
//! (`ptir-lowlevel-runahead-mechanics`, `ptir-pipelined-eos-rollback-spec`,
//! extracted from `runahead::decode_pipelined` @ e750ae4b). Composes the KV
//! page-geometry primitive ([`crate::geometry`]) — a keep-core building block,
//! per `ptir-sdk-minimization-audit`.
