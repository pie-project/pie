//! Shared two-way connection glue for the gateway↔worker data plane.
//!
//! Both [`GatewayInbound`](crate::GatewayInbound) and
//! [`WorkerControl`](crate::WorkerControl) ride a SINGLE worker-initiated
//! connection: the worker dials in, the heavy token traffic flows on the plain
//! client→server direction (`push_tokens`), and the latency-sensitive commands
//! (`dispatch`/`cancel`/…) go reverse on the same socket. This module owns the
//! mux that splits one transport into two tarpc service channels.
//!
//! It lives here — defined ONCE — for the same reason this refactor deleted the
//! twin `WorkerSessionApi` defs: the [`TwoWayMessage`] enum's variant tags must
//! be byte-identical on both ends, and the `(Req1, Resp1, Req2, Resp2)` ordering
//! threaded into [`spawn_twoway`] is the fragile bit — a transposed pair is a
//! silent wire break that still compiles. The two typed constructors
//! [`accept_gateway_link`] / [`connect_gateway_link`] fix that ordering once,
//! named, so each end is a single call:
//!
//! - gateway (`worker.rs`): `let (server_half, wc) = accept_gateway_link(t);`
//!   then `BaseChannel::with_defaults(server_half).execute(GwServer.serve())…`
//!   and hold `wc: WorkerControlClient` for `dispatch`/`cancel`.
//! - worker (dial-in): `let (server_half, gi) = connect_gateway_link(t);` then
//!   serve `WorkerControl` over `server_half` and hold `gi:
//!   GatewayInboundClient`, whose FIRST call must be `register(worker_id)`.
//!
//! NOTE: serve CONCRETELY per end (no generic serve helper) — tarpc 0.35's
//! `Channel::execute` requires `Req: RequestName`, which only the macro-generated
//! `*Request` types satisfy. The serde transport infers `TwoWayMessage` from the
//! wrapper bounds (no codec annotation); set the frame cap the usual way via
//! `config_mut().max_frame_length(N)` — small now that blobs ride HTTP.
//!
//! Proven end-to-end on tarpc 0.35 (both directions on one connection,
//! register-first) before landing.
