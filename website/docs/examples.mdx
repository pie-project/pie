# Examples

A curated collection of inferlet implementations demonstrating Pie's capabilities. Each example is a complete, runnable project.

:::note Coming Soon
Detailed annotated walkthroughs are being added. In the meantime, browse the source code in [`sdk/examples/`](https://github.com/nicepie/pie/tree/main/sdk/examples) and [`inferlets/`](https://github.com/nicepie/pie/tree/main/inferlets).

## By Category

### Chat & Generation
- **Text Completion** — Basic chat-style generation with `InstructExt` + `EventStream`
- **Multi-turn Chat** — Multi-turn conversation with context management

### Agents
- **ReAct Agent** — Reasoning + Acting loop with tool execution

### Structured Output
- **Constrained JSON** — Grammar-constrained decoding with Lark grammars

### Performance
- **Prefix Caching** — Reuse KV cache across requests
- **Speculative Decoding** — Jacobi decoding, CacheBack decoding
- **Parallel Generation** — Multiple generation streams on shared context

### Advanced Attention
- **Windowed Attention** — Sliding window KV cache management
- **Attention Sink** — Fixed sink + sliding window for long sequences

### Reasoning
- **Tree of Thought** — Branching exploration of reasoning paths
- **Graph of Thought** — DAG-based reasoning with merging

### System Integration
- **HTTP Server** — WASI HTTP incoming handler with SSE streaming
- **Image Fetch** — HTTP client for fetching external resources
- **OpenAI-Compatible Server** — Drop-in OpenAI API replacement
